**Introduction:** A brief overview of the application/game, its purpose, and its target audience.

My game is a 3D multiplayer game with 2 teams of at least 1 person that compete against each other. The purpose of the game is to be fun, provide happiness and be universally accessible. It is also meant to exercise your hands when you move them. Competition between the users on the teams encourage active engagement and fosters relationships! The target audience of my game is people who like video games and have computers, like students at Harvard Westlake.

**Value/Use:** A clear and explicit explanation of the value or use provided by the application/game.

As mentioned above, the use of the game is to bring fun to users' lives. It is also meant to encourage active engagement with others playing the game.

**User Interaction and Experience:** A description of how users will interact with the application/game and what their experience will be like.

The users will interact with the game by being players in the game and their experience will be very good.

When the user first clicks on the game, they are brought to a home page that has one button called "Create Game" on it. If the user clicks that button, they are taken to a new page with a unique link (idk how) that they can send to their friends so that they can join the same game.

Once someone joins, they will be prompted by a white popup window to enter a name and choose a charcter. They will then spawn into the blank white screen as their character with their name floating above their head. Then all players will then be randomly split into teams of equal size (or almost equal size if there is an odd # of people). Then they will all spawn in a terrain (maybe a forest? the forest has a lot of trees and bushes in it). The members of each team will be listed in an expandable kind of transparent white box at the top right corner of the screen so people know who is on their team.

Each player will have a weapon that they hold in their hands which shoots out colored circles and they can run around be using "wasd". They can change their view/perspective using the arrow keys. A player can shoot 5 circles at a time (by clicking on people) and then there is a 10 second timer before they can shoot again. If a player is shot more than 7 times within 2 seconds, they die and their character dissapears from the screen and they're no long in the game. 

There are prizes (maybe treasure chests idk) hidden behind trees and bushes and if a player finds it and clicks on it, their team will earn points. A blue prize is +5, a red prize is +10, and a purple prize is +25. Also, when you kill someone your team gets +2. There is a score counter for Team 1 and Team 2 at the top left corner of the page that updates whenever prizes are found. Whichever team has more points by the end of a 1 minute timer wins. There is a popup window that announces the winner at the end.

If you restart the game, the same thing as described above happens and teams are randomly remade.

**Competitive Element:** Details on how the application/game facilitates competition among students.

There is a competitive element because the teams are competing against each other.

**Engagement and Addictiveness Strategies:** An explanation of the features or strategies employed to make the application/game engaging and addictive.

Since multiple people are playing together, the game will be very engaging. Since people like games and like engaging with their friends, the game will be very addictive.

**Scalability and Expansion:** A discussion of how the design allows for future growth and adoption beyond the initial homework assignment.

The design allows for future growth because all people like games so even people outside of Harvard Westlake can play it.

**Accessibility and Inclusivity:** A section detailing how the design adheres to the California non-discrimination clause and ensures inclusivity for all potential users.

This game will not discriminate against anyone and everyone can play it.
